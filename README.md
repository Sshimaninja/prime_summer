## A tiny, ridiculous program to sum two randomly chosen primes 

A user can input any 2 numbers, it will use sympy to find 2 primes between those parameters and then it will sum up those primes.

This program was created for a class, for which the final was to find 2 randomly chosen primes between a given pair of numbers (something like 200 - 10,000), but I didn't like the 'hardcgit oded' nature of the assignment, so I made it so you can input any pair of numbers.

If you input nothing and just press enter though, it will default to the numbers required by the brief, so technially that is fulfilled, while being better than the assignment's expectations.

I doubt anyone will use this program, but if you do, enjoy! (lol)
